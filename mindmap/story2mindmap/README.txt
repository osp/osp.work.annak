An experiment to see if it would be interesting to describe the mindmap above
in "natural language", and then markup this story with rdfa to re-produce the
mindmaps. A little bit like Knuth's [Literate programming](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literate_programming).

Use `./visualize_rdfa.sh` to produce the mindmaps.
